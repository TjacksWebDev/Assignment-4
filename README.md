**Assignment-4: Student Enrollment Data Management**

This GitHub repository contains the solution to Assignment-4, a data management task for college professors. As a Data Scientist working for a college, our mission is to assist professors in handling the student enrollment data effectively.

**Assignment Overview:**

In this assignment, we are tasked with helping professors from three different classes manage their student enrollment lists. The challenge is that professors were provided with a single CSV file containing a "master list" of all students across all courses. However, each professor requires a separate CSV file containing only their own students, grouped by course.

Our job involves parsing the master list file and separating the data into three distinct CSV files, each representing a specific course. Additionally, we need to ensure that the student records in each CSV file are sorted by grade in descending order, making it easier for professors to analyze their students' performance.

**Key Features:**

- Data parsing and separation into three distinct CSV files.
- Sorting student records by grade in descending order for each course.
- Use of Java to manage and process CSV data.
- Helpful hints provided in the README for handling null entries, writing to files, and parsing string input into integers.

**Example Output:**

The repository includes example output files, named `course1.csv`, `course2.csv`, and `course3.csv`, showcasing the expected format of the sorted student enrollment data.

**Usage:**

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Review the provided code and follow the hints for handling data.
3. Customize the code for your specific use case if needed.
4. Execute the code to generate the required CSV files for your professors.
